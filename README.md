# GTFormer: a Geospatial Temporal Transformer for Crowd Flow Prediction

This repository is the official implementation of [GTFormer: a Geospatial Temporal Transformer for Crowd Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiment

1. Download data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B9WRpkfHn48VfkaHjnErgQ5yb8Vv6PSj?usp=drive_link) and put into /data/NYC or /data/DC.


2. We provide the experiment scripts of all models under the folder ./scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results by:
   ```
   ./scripts/NYC/GTFormer.sh
   ./scripts/DC/GTFormer.sh
   ``` 


## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on OD flow predicton:
